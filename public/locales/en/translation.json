    "title": "About me",
    "html": "<p>Hello!</br></br>I'm Caio and I am a software engineer.</br></br>I'm a dedicated problem solver with a passion for using software to tackle business and individual challenges. I'm the type of person who believes that there's always room for improvement, which is why I find joy in refactoring and relentlessly pursuing the optimal solutions. This mindset drives me to incorporate unit tests as a regular practice in my daily work.</br></br>With over five years of experience in software development, a significant portion of my journey has been within the banking industry. My involvement has spanned a diverse range of projects, from the user's initial interaction with the bank during account creation to optimizing internal workflows. I approach technology with an open mind and haven't tied myself to any particular operating system, programming language, or technology. However, a majority of the projects I've contributed to have utilized the .NET stack (both Framework and Core), Angular, and SQL Server.</br></br>In my free time when I am not working on my applications (one of them is listed in the Projects section below), I am trying to learn something new by reading books, watching video courses, or teaching friends. Also, I am a cyclist enthusiast and love to be on the road riding my bike!</p>"
